100 points total

 3 - student_data.txt - It is a Unix file and runs with solution code (student's run_test.c and/or the instructor's solution). Points for this will be given even if the student did not implement run_test.c .  

 7 - heap_calls.c file compiles and runs with the student's heap.c 
	* 3 - no Valgrind errors

21 - run_test.c
	* 4 - reads array from file into dynamically allocated memory	
	* 14 - correctly extracts each operation: 
		** 2pts - *
		** 4pts - sS 
		** 4pts - pP 
		** 4pts number for add operation	
	* 3 - no Valgrind errors

	* 2 - heapify is implemented
	* 2 - swim_up is implemented

	* 13 - poll
		** 10 - correct remove (heap is fixed after removal)
